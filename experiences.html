My Resume</a></p>
<p>Hello, I’m Xuan Lu, a second-year MPH student in Epidemiology at
Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health, specializing in
Applied Biostatistics. I hold a BS degree in Psychology with a Life
Sciences option from The Pennsylvania State University. Below summarizes
my past academic and professional experiences. If you have any
questions, feel free to <a href="xl3214@cumc.columbia.edu">email
me</a>.</p>
<div id="education" class="section level2">
<h2>Education</h2>
<p>My education has not just been about accruing degrees, but rather
laying down a robust foundation in the multifaceted domain of public
health. My academic pursuits encompass a spectrum: from epidemiological
research methods and observational study designs to both quantitative
and qualitative research techniques. The nuances of statistical
analysis, data management, and a distinct proficiency in the R
programming language are areas I pride myself on, thanks to the rigorous
academic environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="early-research-endeavors" class="section level2">
<h2>Early Research Endeavors</h2>
<p>Before setting foot into the world-renowned halls of Columbia, I had
already ventured into the challenging realm of healthcare research. At
the Peking University Institute of Mental Health, I served as a research
assistant, privileged to work under the mentorship of Dr. Weihua Yue,
the institute’s deputy director. During this phase, I plunged into
significant projects, the most notable being the “Antipsychotic-induced
Weight Gain Genome-wide Association Study and Mendelian Randomization.”
My roles varied and enriched me - from conducting clinical interviews
and reviewing extensive literature to managing data collection,
analysis, and dissemination through scholarly writings. Engaging with
diverse clinical patients offered profound insights, solidifying my
commitment to healthcare.</p>
</div>
<div id="real-world-applications" class="section level2">
<h2>Real-World Applications</h2>
<p>My analytical journey saw another milestone during my recent
internship with Dr. Alaei at the Institute for International Health and
Education. Entrusted with a large-scale national health database in
Tajikistan, I navigated through over 15,000 observations and 280
variables. This wasn’t just about numbers but about translating
theoretical knowledge to practical applications. My responsibilities
extended from absorbing academic writings on HIV/AIDS to ensuring the
integrity of data translation, cleaning, and rigorous analysis. It was
an affirmation of the critical role of precision and attention to detail
in policymaking.</p>
<p>In the dynamic landscape of healthcare, challenges emerge at every
step. However, with a foundation rooted in rigorous academic training
and real-world research experiences, I am eager to bring about
innovative, research-driven solutions. I view every challenge as an
opportunity to learn, grow, and contribute meaningfully to this
ever-evolving field.</p>
